## 1. Overview
CoinRing (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) is a cryptocurrency tracking app that lets you monitor prices, set alerts, and receive notifications.  
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## 2. Accounts & Authentication (Supabase)
Accounts are optional. If you create an account, authentication is handled via **Supabase**.

We may store:
- Email address
- Account metadata (e.g., account creation timestamp)
- Subscription / plan information (if applicable)

We do **not** store your password directly.

## 3. Data We Process
Depending on how you use the app, we may process:

### A) Account Data (logged-in users)
- Email address
- Account and plan status
- Data you create in the app (e.g., alerts)

### B) Push Notification Data
- Device push token (to deliver alerts via Apple Push Notification service – APNs)
- Notification delivery status (where applicable)

### C) Analytics (Mixpanel)
We use **Mixpanel** to collect app usage and interaction data to understand how the app is used and to improve features and performance (e.g., screens visited, feature usage, interaction events).

Analytics data is typically **pseudonymous** and not intended to directly identify individual users.

### D) Advertising (Google AdMob)
If you use the free version, the app may display ads via **Google AdMob**.  
AdMob may process data such as:
- Device identifiers
- Approximate location
- Ad interactions

### E) Device / Technical Data
We may process non-identifying technical information (e.g., app version, device model, operating system version) for stability, analytics, and debugging.

### F) Support & Communication (Crisp)
If you contact us via in-app support, we use **Crisp** to handle support messages.

This may include:
- Messages you send to us
- Metadata related to the support request (e.g., timestamp, device information if provided)

Support communication is used solely to respond to inquiries and provide assistance.

## 4. Why We Use This Data
We use data to:
- Provide core functionality (accounts, alerts, syncing)
- Deliver notifications
- Analyze usage and improve the app

These providers process data under their own privacy policies and agreements.

## 6. Market Data
Market data is provided by third-party sources and is provided **as-is**.  
We do not guarantee accuracy or completeness.

You may request deletion of your account and associated data via in-app support.

## 9. Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
Updates will be published on this page, and continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
